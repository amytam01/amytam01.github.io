**Summer 2021**, I worked from home as a **product manager intern** on the SAAW team at **Alarm.com**. My final week was spent in headquarters in Tysons, Virginia where I had walked more in a week (exploring Virginia) than I had in the past 6 months.

### 1. Validate, validate, validate!
Before this internship, I had worked in startups as a product manager. In startup culture, you don't always have the data or resources to validate your assumptions and are required to heavily rely on beta-users or qualitative data direct from the user (which isn't bad, but probably is not ideal). At Alarm.com, I had to learn to slow down and validate my assumptions by leveraging business insight reports and quantitative data. I spent my first 5 weeks during my internship rewiring myself to validating my assumptions and talk to stakeholders to ensure I understood all aspects of my project.

### 2. Resourcing + prioritization + probably my most important lesson as a PM
Summer vacations, innovation weeks, more pressing projects. Unexpected roadblocks piled on and pushed back aspects of my project due to a lack of resourcing. For a few days, I did my best to push for any possible way to gain an extra sliver of resourcing for my project. However, as an intern with a few weeks under her belt, I came to realize that I had absolutely no idea what was going on (besides the 1 minute explanation provided) and that there was a limit to my polite prodding. 
<br><br>
This taught me several important lessons: A. Not everything is about you, especially at a billion dollar corporation, B. Project management and scheduling is difficult even if you think you've done all the necessary steps, C. Just because you don't see something or hear about something happening doesn't mean it isn't (especially during a pandemic), D. If something can't be done now, make it as easy as possible for it to be done later (documentation, tickets in place, alignment meetings etc).

### 3. Coffee Chats
Even in a remote setting, I was able to set up coffee chats and meet with 50+ people across the organization. The most cheesy answer to every interview I've been in for "What's your favorite thing about your company" has been "my team" or "the people", but I can really say that this is the case at Alarm.com. The culture of kindness and generosity is astounding, and while I have yet to meet a company/team that I've disliked working with, Alarm.com has made me truly love its people.

I'd like to thank my mentor, Michael Li, and my fellow interns for always being there for me.
I'd also like to thank Alarm.com for last-minute deciding to fly non-local interns into HQ for their final week and giving me a week to remember.
