From 2016-2018, I was **Co-Owner of InspirinqCo** and redeveloped the website, managed products, and oversaw public relations and partnerships with influencers with a net following of more than 4 million on Instagram. More often than not, I was wearing many different hats answering thousands of messages from customers, making our new designs and setting up meetings to discuss marketing with our ambassadors.

### 1. Redeveloped website and brand identity
<br>
As a company who donated 10% of our proceeds towards mental health awareness, I found it important to return to purpose behind our company and redesign our brand identity. Thus, we partnered with TWLOHA and redesigned our logo with the ';' along with other changes. Quoted from an anonymous person: "A semicolon is used when an author could've chosen to end their sentence, but chose not to. The author is you, and the sentence is your life‚Äù.

### 2. Improved marketing and business strategy
<br>
We shifted our business strategy from selling apparel to partnering with up and coming social media influencers to help them develop clothing lines to sell to their fan base. In doing so, we took a portion of the profits from every sale they made, and we recieved "free" advertising for our other products. This was a great way to rapidly increase our exposure and business, making for a win win situation as we would handle the logistics.
<br><br>
In addition, we began utilizing unique marketing strategies including giveaways, and affliliate marketing. Upon one week of releasing a new giveaway, in which customers had to reach 10,000 likes on their post in order to recieve a free item, we recieved a flood of hundreds of submissions, and gave away about $200 worth of product but were able to sell nearly $5,000 worth of product in addition to incredible amounts of advertising.
