## Ontopical

**Spring 2021**, given the flexibility of taking college classes online, I decided to pick up a few part time jobs (I ended up picking up 3), one of which was becoming a **junior product manager** at a Canadian startup, **Ontopical**.

Here is a sneak peak at what I did without breaking my NDA! :)

### 1. Starting from ground zero - a new PM
Before this internship, I had worked in product design roles, software engineering roles, project management roles, and even ran my own business. All of these roles gave me a taste of something I enjoyed doing, but this was the first time I truly fell in love and felt like I truly understood what it meant to be a product manager.

### 2. Throwing myself all in
The restrictions on my job responsibilities were very loosely defined, and working at a startup was like steering a ship through the storm, even remotely. Day one, I created new mock ups for the entire web app as a way for me to gain a better understanding of Ontopical's SaaS product, and for Chris, my manager and Ontopical's COO/CTO, to remedy any of my misunderstandings about it which were apparent in my design.

I'd like to thank my Chris Fulton, Ontopical's COO/CTO, for taking a chance on me, and Maria Shanina, Sr. Product Designer at Shopify, for referring me.
